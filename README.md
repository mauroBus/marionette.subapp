# Marionette.SubApp

*Marionette.SubApp* is a simple combination of *Marionette.Layout* and *Marionette.AppRouter* to build a module (or Sub Application). SubApp enables easily to plug and unplug a set of views, either simple or composed, encapsuled by a main container that also handles the routing system between its own sub views.

This repo also defines a boilerplate, defining reusable "components" and a set of "modules" (sub-apps) that are built with diferent components.

## Instalation

Just prepare a cup of coffee and run `npm install` and then `bower install`. With a little of luck everything will go alright. Once installed, to see it shining just run the Grunt task `grunt server`.
